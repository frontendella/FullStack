# FullStack

* Bulk Email Sending: The application will enable the sending of a large number of emails to different users.

* Billing: There may be a billing component in the application, indicating that the service of sending emails may not be free.

* User Accounts: The application will require user authentication and user account management.


## The user will interact with the feedback collection application. The steps are as follows:

* Authentication: Users will sign in or sign up using Google OAuth, simplifying the authentication process.

* Payment: After signing in, users will be prompted to add money to their account or make a payment. The application will use a credit-based system, where users purchase credits that allow them to send a specific number of emails.

* Campaign/Survey Creation: Once the user has paid, they can create a new campaign or survey. They will enter a list of emails to whom they want to send the survey. The user here represents a product owner or startup owner who wants to collect feedback from their application users.

* Email Sending: The application will send an email with a feedback link to all the specified email addresses. The recipients can click on the link to provide feedback.

* Feedback Collection: The application will collect the feedback provided by the recipients of the email surveys.

* Report Generation: The collected feedback will be tabulated and summarized into a report, allowing the user to gain insights into their application's feedback and user opinions.
